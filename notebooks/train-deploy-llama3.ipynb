    "Evaluating LLMs is crucial for understanding their capabilities and limitations, yet it poses significant challenges due to their complex and opaque nature. There are multiple ways to evaluate a fine-tuned model. You could either use an additional Training job to evaluate the model as we demonstrated in [Evaluate LLMs with Hugging Face Lighteval on Amazon SageMaker](https://www.philschmid.de/sagemaker-evaluate-llm-lighteval) or you can deploy the model to an endpoint and interactively test the model. We are going to use the latter approach in this example. We will load our eval dataset and evaluate the model on those samples, using a simple loop and accuracy as our metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: Evaluating Generative AI models is not a trivial task since 1 input can have multiple correct outputs. If you want to learn more about evaluating generative models, check out [Evaluate LLMs and RAG a practical example using Langchain and Hugging Face](https://www.philschmid.de/evaluate-llm) blog post._\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use the [Hugging Face LLM Inference DLC](https://huggingface.co/blog/sagemaker-huggingface-llm#what-is-hugging-face-llm-inference-dlc) a purpose-built Inference Container to easily deploy LLMs in a secure and managed environment. The DLC is powered by [Text Generation Inference (TGI)](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/index) solution for deploying and serving Large Language Models (LLMs)."
