    "# How to Fine-Tune LLMs in 2024 on Amazon SageMaker\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models or LLMs have seen a lot of progress in the last year. We went from no ChatGPT competitor to a whole zoo of LLMs, including Meta AI's [Llama 2](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf), Mistrals [Mistral](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2) & [Mixtral](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1) models, TII [Falcon](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b), and many more.\n",
    "Those LLMs can be used for a variety of tasks, including chatbots, question answering, summarization without any additional training. However, if you want to customize a model for your application. You may need to fine-tune the model on your data to achieve higher quality results than prompting or saving cost by training smaller models more efficient model.\n",

    "## 2. Create and prepare the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "After our environment is set up, we can start creating and preparing our dataset. A fine-tuning dataset should have a diverse set of demonstrations of the task you want to solve. There are several ways to create such a dataset, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using existing open-source datasets, e.g., [Spider](https://huggingface.co/datasets/spider)\n",
    "- Using LLMs to create synthetically datasets, e.g., [Alpaca](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tatsu-lab/alpaca)\n",
    "- Using Humans to create datasets, e.g., [Dolly](https://huggingface.co/datasets/databricks/databricks-dolly-15k).\n",
    "- Using a combination of the above methods, e.g., [Orca](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Open-Orca/OpenOrca)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the methods has its own advantages and disadvantages and depends on the budget, time, and quality requirements. For example, using an existing dataset is the easiest but might not be tailored to your specific use case, while using humans might be the most accurate but can be time-consuming and expensive. It is also possible to combine several methods to create an instruction dataset, as shown in [Orca: Progressive Learning from Complex Explanation Traces of GPT-4.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02707)\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example we will use an already existing dataset called [sql-create-context](https://huggingface.co/datasets/b-mc2/sql-create-context), which contains samples of natural language instructions, schema definitions and the corresponding SQL query.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use `trl` for fine-tuning, which supports popular instruction and conversation dataset formats. This means we only need to convert our dataset to one of the supported formats and `trl` will take care of the rest. Those formats include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- conversational format\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are...\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"...\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"...\"}]}\n",
    "{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are...\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"...\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"...\"}]}\n",
    "{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are...\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"...\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"...\"}]}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- instruction format\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\"prompt\": \"<prompt text>\", \"completion\": \"<ideal generated text>\"}\n",
    "{\"prompt\": \"<prompt text>\", \"completion\": \"<ideal generated text>\"}\n",
    "{\"prompt\": \"<prompt text>\", \"completion\": \"<ideal generated text>\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example we are going to load our open-source dataset using the 🤗 Datasets library and then convert it into the the conversational format, where we include the schema definition in the system message for our assistant. We'll then save the dataset as jsonl file, which we can then use to fine-tune our model. We are randomly downsampling the dataset to only 10,000 samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: This step can be different for your use case. For example, if you have already a dataset from, e.g. working with OpenAI, you can skip this step and go directly to the fine-tuning step._\n"

    "\n",
    "We are now ready to fine-tune our model. We will use the [SFTTrainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/sft_trainer) from `trl` to fine-tune our model. The `SFTTrainer` makes it straightfoward to supervise fine-tune open LLMs. The `SFTTrainer` is a subclass of the `Trainer` from the `transformers` library and supports all the same features, including logging, evaluation, and checkpointing, but adds additiional quality of life features, including:\n",

    "- Dataset formatting, including conversational and instruction format\n",
    "- Training on completions only, ignoring prompts\n",
    "- Packing datasets for more efficient training\n",
    "- PEFT (parameter-efficient fine-tuning) support including Q-LoRA\n",
    "- Preparing the model and tokenizer for conversational fine-tuning (e.g. adding special tokens)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the dataset formatting, packing and PEFT features in our example. As peft method we will use [QLoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314) a technique to reduce the memory footprint of large language models during finetuning, without sacrificing performance by using quantization. If you want to learn more about QLoRA and how it works, check out [Making LLMs even more accessible with bitsandbytes, 4-bit quantization and QLoRA](https://huggingface.co/blog/4bit-transformers-bitsandbytes) blog post. \n",
    "In Addition to QLoRA we will leverage the new [Flash Attention 2 integrationg with Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/perf_infer_gpu_one#flash-attention-2) to speed up the training. Flash Attention 2 is a new efficient attention mechanism that is up to 3x faster than the standard attention mechanism. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We prepared a [run_sft.py](./scripts/trl/run_sft.py), which uses `trl` with all of the features describe above. The script is re-usable, but still hackable if you want to make changes. Paramters are provided via CLI arguments using the [HFArgumentParser](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/internal/trainer_utils#transformers.HfArgumentParser), which cann parse any CLI argument from the [TrainingArguments](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.38.2/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.TrainingArguments) or from our [ScriptArguments](./scripts/trl/run_sft.py).\n",

    "Evaluating LLMs is crucial for understanding their capabilities and limitations, yet it poses significant challenges due to their complex and opaque nature. There are multiple ways to evaluate a fine-tuned model. You could either use an additional Training job to evaluate the model as we demonstrated in [Evaluate LLMs with Hugging Face Lighteval on Amazon SageMaker](https://www.philschmid.de/sagemaker-evaluate-llm-lighteval) or you can deploy the model to an endpoint and interactively test the model. We are going to use the latter approach in this example. We will load our eval dataset and evaluate the model on those samples, using a simple loop and accuracy as our metric.\n",
