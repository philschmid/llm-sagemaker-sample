    "# Deploy Llama 3 on Amazon SageMaker\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier today Meta released [Llama 3](https://huggingface.co/blog/llama3), the next iteration of the open-access Llama family. Llama 3 comes in two sizes: [8B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct) for efficient deployment and development on consumer-size GPU, and [70B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-instruct) for large-scale AI native applications. Both come in base and instruction-tuned variants. In addition to the 4 models, a new version of Llama Guard was fine-tuned on Llama 3 8B and is released as Llama Guard 2 (safety fine-tune).\n",

    "In this blog you will learn how to deploy [meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct) model to Amazon SageMaker. We are going to use the Hugging Face LLM DLC is a purpose-built Inference Container to easily deploy LLMs in a secure and managed environment. The DLC is powered by [Text Generation Inference (TGI)](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference) a scalelable, optimized solution for deploying and serving Large Language Models (LLMs).

      "1. **Multiple layers**: Deep learning models have multiple layers of neural networks, which allow them to learn complex patterns and representations in data.\n",

      "3. **Automatic feature learning**: Deep learning models can automatically learn features and representations from the data, without the need for manual feature engineering.\n",
      "4. **Large amounts of data**: Deep learning models require large amounts of data to train, and they can learn to recognize patterns and make predictions based on that data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the key benefits of deep learning include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Improved accuracy**: Deep learning models can achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and game playing.\n",
      "2. **Ability to handle large datasets**: Deep learning models can handle large amounts of data and learn to recognize patterns and make predictions based on that data.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: These are commonly used for image recognition and computer vision tasks.\n",
      "2. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: These are commonly used for natural language processing and speech recognition tasks.\n",
      "3. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: These are commonly used for generating new data, such as images or music, that resembles existing data.\n",

The benchmark is not a full representation of the model performance, but it gives you a first good indication. If you plan to use the model in production, we recommend to run a longer and closer to your production benchmark, modify the number of replicas see ([Scale LLM Inference on Amazon SageMaker with Multi-Replica Endpoints](https://www.philschmid.de/sagemaker-multi-replicahttps://www.philschmid.de/sagemaker-multi-replica)) and most importantly test the model with your own data."
